## Coding Challenges

### Array Manipulation

**Problem Statement:**
Given an array of integers and a target sum, determine if there exists a contiguous subarray within the array that sums up to the target. Return true if such a subarray exists, otherwise return false.

**Example:**

```sh
Input: arr = [4, 2, 7, 1, 9, 5], target = 17
Output: true
```
